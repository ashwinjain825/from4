FROM4 – India’s Smart Digital Addressing

From4 is a precise, shareable, and reliable digital location addressing system for India. 
It divides the country into small 4m × 4m units, each with a unique alphanumeric code derived 
from latitude and longitude, making location identification simple and accurate.

Features:

- Developer-Friendly: Future API support for integrating location services into apps and websites.

Demo:
- Web Interface: Users can view their From4 code by fetching their location on the map.
